The franchise has seen a collective downturn of success and is in need of a full rebuild in order to regain parity with the league. The most immeadiate way to address this is to locate and sign quality veteran players.

## Data:
Outsourced from fivethirtyeight; utilizes a handful of metrics but we narrow it down to possessions, total minutes played, WAR, RAPTOR, Pace Impact, PREDATOR and On/Off score

## Methods:
Cleaned the data, removed a lot of unncessary features and averaged out all the stats of each player, then removed any prospect that had any negative stats.

## Results:
